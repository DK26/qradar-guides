# QRadar 7.3.1 Community Edition Installation Manual  

=======================================

Source: https://github.com/DK26/qradar-guides/blob/master/QRadarInstallation/InstallationManual.md


* Some of the steps in the official manual aren't complete or have errors in them, thus I've created this manual.

* Here is what I did to make it work on VirtualBox:

1. Create a new Machine for Linux: Red Hat 64-bit.

2. Allocate it 16GB RAM, 4 Cores (8 is better if your system allows it) and 150GB's for a virtual Hard Drive.

3. Insert the file `CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1804.iso` to the virtual CD/DVD-ROM.

	- The iso file you are inserting is a CentOS 7.5 image which is the only version QRadar CE 7.3.2 can work with.

	- Keep that iso file close because it wasn't a simple process to get it now that 7.6 is out and there are no 7.5 images anymore.

4. Follow the next steps from the official manual (`b_qradar_community_edition.pdf`):

	Page 3: Step 2 to step 3.d
	
	* Make sure hostname has a dot (.) in it as QRadar installations requires a fully qualified domain name.

5. On step 3.e:

	* They kinda forgot to mention..

	* Since QRadar is going to be installed under the root partition ("/"), make sure the root partition has at least 130GBs allocated to it and the swap partition has at least 8GBs and only then go on with the rest of the partitions.

6. Keep on through steps 3.f to step 4

7. Step 5: Disabling SELinux (https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-disable-selinux-on-centos-7/):

	1. Run the next commands as root (if you're running as non-root user, just use 'sudo' at the beginning of each command):

		a. Run the command:  
		
		  `vi /etc/selinux/config`

	    b. Press the `insert` button on your keyboard to the edit.

		c. Go to: `SELINUX=`

		d. Update the `SELINUX` value to `disabled`:  
		
		  `SELINUX=disabled`
       
	    e. Press the ESC button to stop 'INSERT' mode and then enter the following line: `:wq`   
	        - `:wq` - This will write(w) to file and quit(q) VI

		f. Reset the virtual machine with the command:  
		
		  `shutdown -r now`
			
		g. When the machine is running again and you're logged, make sure SELinux is disabled by running the command:
		
		  `sestatus`


8. Mounting the QRadar CE ISO file:

	a. Insert into the virtual machine CD-DVD ROM the ISO file: `QRadarCE7_3_1.GA.iso`

	b. Run the following command:  
	
	  `mkdir /media/cdrom`
	   
	c. Mount the ISO with the following command:
	
	  `mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom`

9. Run QRadar CE Installation (First Run):

    `/media/cdrom/setup`

	

10. Accept all questions to processed with the Installation.

11. In the end you will get a message telling you to restart the machine. Use the command:

    `shutdown -r now`
    

12. When you are logged in again, repeat step 8.c and then run the setup again (repeat step 9)

13. Wait for the installation to complete.

14. Continue with step 8 in page 4.
